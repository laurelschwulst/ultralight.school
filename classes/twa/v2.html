          <p>
            In “TWA: Total Work of Art,” we invite artists, designers, writers,
            programmers, and anyone else interested to shapeshift their concept
            across three modalities: 1) digital, 2) physical, and 3) temporal.
            Inspired by wide-ranging examples of design as world-building —
            think Bauhaus, Beyoncé, Bernadette Corporation — this workshop
            responds to how culture is experienced today, inviting participants
            to develop a core concept across multiple forms and points of
            access.
          </p>
          <p>
            This 7 week workshop is led by three teachers: Stephen Kwok, Laurel
            Schwulst, and Bryant Wells. Meeting twice a week (on Thursdays and
            Sundays), each session includes conversational lectures, technical
            demonstrations, presentation and critique time, and guest visits.
            The workshop culminates in a public event in which the participants
            present the totality of their work.

          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>Our idea for this course began with three disparate references:</p>
          <!-- <p>
            A graduate studio art course Stephen took at School of the Art
            Institute of Chicago called Shapeshifters, the business-world
            concept of touchpoints, and a quote by Christopher Alexander about
            increasing surface area of a strawberry.
          </p> -->
          <p>
            1 ) <i>Shapeshifters</i> was a class Stephen took at the School of
            the Art Institute of Chicago. Taught by Frederic Moffet, it invited
            students to create works for three predetermined moments of
            presentation: a screening, an exhibition, and an evening of
            performance. Within this bare but demanding structure, students were
            given the opportunity to realize a dynamic and multidisciplinary
            bodies of work alongside each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            2 ) <i>Touchpoints</i> is a marketing concept which refers to the
            various modalities through which consumers interact with a brand.
            Examples of touchpoints include advertisements, social media posts,
            in-store experiences, and encounters with customer service
            representatives. Marketing professionals commonly believe that such
            touchpoints shape consumers’ brand perception and purchasing
            decisions throughout the conventionally defined decision-making
            process: before, during, and after purchase.
          </p>
          <p>
            3 ) In his book <i>A Timeless Way of Building</i>, the architect and
            design theorist Christopher Alexander shares: “The finer I slice the
            strawberries, the more surfaces there are; the more surfaces there
            are, the more it tastes.” Through increasing surface area,
            generously considering entries, exits, and traversal patterns, an
            idea becomes more accessible — open to air.
          </p>
          <p>
            All three frameworks encourage a medium and discipline agnostic
            approach to making.
          </p>
          <p>
            What if we adopted these approaches for our own projects? What if we
            start with the interplay between modalities, rather than needing a
            single form to contain the essence of a work? What if there is no
            “primary” way to experience something anymore?
          </p>

          <h2>TWA: Total Work of Art</h2>

          <p>TWA: Total Work of Art “Total Work of Art” entered the chat.</p>
          <p>
            According to Wikipedia, a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesamtkunstwerk"
              >Gesamtkunstwerk</a
            >
            can mean a “total work of art,” a “universal artwork,” or a
            “synthesis of the arts.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Richard Wagner, a composer known primarily for his operas,
            popularized the term throughout his career which explored combining
            musical, visual, and dramatic art into an all-embracing theatrical
            whole.
          </p>
          <p>
            As described in Fred Turner's book <i>The Democratic Surround</i>,
            artist and Bauhaus art school educator László Moholy-Nagy argued
            that design schools offer the kind of training that would strengthen
            individual American character and American society as a whole in the
            face of fascism in a 1940 article titled “Relating the Parts to the
            Whole” —
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            “WE NEED IN LARGE NUMBERS a new type of person — one who sees the
            periphery as well as the immediate, and who can integrate his
            special job with the great whole of which it is a small part. This
            ability is a matter of everyday efficiency. It will also contribute
            to building a better culture.”
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            Suddenly, examples appeared everywhere, from Bauhaus and Corbusier
            to Beyoncé’s Lemonade and Kpop, Catholic Mass, it seemed as if there
            were no piece of culture in 2025 that didn’t have simultaneous
            physical, digital, and temporally-based modes of encounter. As our
            understanding of what could be considered gesamtkunstwerk expanded,
            so did our curiosity about what reconsidering this art historical
            concept in today’s climate might provoke. As our understanding of
            what could be considered Gesamtkunstwerk expanded, so did our
            curiosity about (the political / creative provocations of) what
            reconsidering this art historical concept might do today. How can we
            make a new form of gesamtkunstwerk today in 2025? We call it “TWA.”
