          <p>Hi everyone,</p>
          <p>
            This summer 2025, beginning in June, we are hosting a few exciting
            classes based physically in NYC!
          </p>
          <p>
            This is happening under a new educational umbrella project called
            “<a href="https://ultralight.school">ultralight.school</a>” (and
            also the website you are on right now) — which we will share more
            about momentarily; but first, the classes:
          </p>
          <p>***</p>
          <p>Our summer 2025 classes:</p>
          <p>
            TWA: Total Work of Art — In this 7 week class, meeting on Thursday
            evenings and Sunday afternoons in June, July, and part of August,
            participants come in with one core concept (“point of departure”)
            and shapeshift it through multiple modalities: 1) digital, 2)
            physical, and 3) temporal. Inspired by wide-ranging examples of
            design as world-building — think Bauhaus, Beyoncé, Bernadette
            Corporation — this class responds to how culture is experienced
            today, inviting participants to develop across multiple forms,
            points, and moments of access. This class is taught by Bryant Wells,
            Stephen Kwok, and Laurel Schwulst and hosted at telos.haus in East
            Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sense to Sense — In this 5 week class, meeting on Sunday evenings
            and Monday evenings in June and July, participants explore
            translation and the senses through writing exercises and a final
            group publication. We’ll also engage in readings and discussion
            about the five senses and what it means to carry sensations over
            into written form. How can a fragrance become a poem? What are the
            different ways to write an image, or to document a sound? This class
            is taught by Meg Miller and Laurel Schwulst and hosted in Boerum
            Hill, Brooklyn.
          </p>
          <p>
            Walking the Internet — In this 3 week class, we will meet three
            consecutive Saturday afternooons in July to explore physical and
            cultural infrastructure in New York City. How does one “see” the
            internet, anyway? We will explore how the internet is not some
            ethereal, untouchable thing, but physically rooted — connected by
            underwater submarine cables and served from data centers containing
            many literal computers worldwide. This class also has a reading and
            discussion component. It is taught by Alex Wolfe and Laurel Schwulst
            and begins in different places in Manhattan each week.
          </p>

          <p>So what is Ultralight School, anyway?</p>

            Speaking of strawberries, Ultralight School is a next evolution of
            <a href="https://fruitful.school">Fruitful School</a> (2020–24),
            which explored how contemporary artistic practices engaged with the
            world wide web or technology at large.

            Initiated by Laurel Schwulst,
            <a href="https://ultralight.school">Ultralight School</a> (Summer
            2025) is rooted in Laurel’s research around the word “<a

              target="_blank"

            — and what lightness means from literal, literary, and living points
            of view.
          </p>
          <p>***</p>
          <p>Let’s look at the word “ultralight” in some detail:</p>
          <p>
            Ultralight — Ultralight is a word that means extremely lightweight.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultra — The prefix “ultra-” can mean “very” or “extremely.” And it
            also means “on the other side of” or “beyond.” For example, the word
            “ultraviolet” is “light beyond the visible spectrum,” and
            “ultrasound” is “sound waves or vibrations of a frequency beyond
            what human ears can hear.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Light — In the word “ultralight,” the suffix “-light” refers to
            weight. For instance, the word ultralight is shorthand for a
            <a
              href="https://www.eaa.org/eaa/aviation-interests/ultralights"
              target="_blank"
              >lightweight aircraft</a
            >. Ultralight also describes a genre of lightweight backpacking
            equipment (<a
              href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/"
              target="_blank"
              >r/Ultralight</a
            >) which ideally makes your journey less burdensome. When taken from
            a more literary or metaphorical vantage, lightness can be about
            seeing the world in a new way:

              width="200"

                should fly like Perseus into a different space. I don’t mean
                escaping into dreams or into the irrational. I mean that I have
                to change my approach, look at the world from a different
                perspective, with a different logic and with fresh methods of
                cognition and verification...”</i

          <p>
            This is not to say that heaviness does not also have its merits.
            Life is about balance — “light” is only possible because of “heavy,”
            and vice versa.

            Ultralight School’s symbol is a sunbeam emanating in all directions
            from an invisible house. Similarly, ultralight is about different
            ways of experiencing something. This summer, we are exploring this
            through 3 classes: “TWA: Total Work of Art” encourages shapeshifting
            a project across multiple points of access. Similarly, “Sense to
            Sense” is about multisensorial translation. And in “Walking the
            Internet,” we learn about the internet in a new way: through
            physicality and movement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that our classes this summer are all in-person in New York
            City. If they go well, we may explore some virtual classses or
            aspects. For now, we want to start locally, but do let us know if
            you’d take a virtual class! This is a beginning.
