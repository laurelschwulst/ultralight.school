              Sense to Sense is a publishing workshop about translation and the
              senses. Over five weeks, participants will engage in readings and
              discussion about the five senses and explore what it means to
              carry sensations over into written form. How can a fragrance
              become a poem? What are the different ways to write an image, or
              to document a sound?
            </p>
            <p>
              Ursula Le Guin says, “all writing is translation” — from the
              perceptual into language. Similarly, we’ll look toward the senses
              to expand our use of language, to break us out of writing ruts,
              and to strengthen our writing voices. By the end of class, we’ll
              collect and publish some of our writing experiments into a
              publication, and possibly translate this publication, which we’re
              curious to explore in different mediums as well — audio, video,
              web, etc…
            </p>
            <p>
              This class happens two consecutive days of the week (Sunday &
              Monday) for five weeks. We’ll meet: 1) Virtually on Sundays for
              one hour reading discussions, 2) In-person in Brooklyn, NY on
              Mondays for three hours of exercises, sharing work, and
              publication making.

            <h2 class="sense-underline">Background</h2>

            <p>
              Translation is traditionally understood as between languages — in
              <i>The Philosophy of Translation</i>, Damion Searls traces
              translation back to its Latin root <i>translatio</i>, meaning “to
              carry across.” The Renaissance later introduced <i>traductio</i>,
              or <i>traduction</i>, shifting the emphasis from simple transport
              to a holistic transformation — one that preserves the essence, or
              soul, of the original in an entirely new form. Walter Benjamin, in
              <i>The Task of the Translator</i>, similarly suggests that
              translation is not about equivalence but transformation, a process
              that illuminates the original by placing it in a new constellation
              of meaning. This class extends translation ideas beyond language,
              asking: what happens when something moves from one sense into
              another?
            </p>
            <p>
              Artists, in many ways, are natural translators. Art makes the
              world unfamiliar so we can see it anew. The people who make art,
              artists, are naturally sensitive and attuned to enchantment,
              estrangement, and sensation — qualities that make them skilled at
              transmitting meaning across boundaries.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our class name, “Sense to Sense,” is a play on the term
              “sense-for-sense translation.” This is an approach to translation
              that prioritizes transmitting the overall meaning of the text — as
              opposed to “word-for-word translation,” a literal translation of
              every word. It’s the oldest norm for translation, stretching back
              to Cicero.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this context, “sense” is of course referring to a
              <i>meaning conveyed or intended</i>. But we couldn’t help but
              think about that other definition of “sense,” the one referring to
              smell, sight, hearing, taste, and touch.
            </p>

            <p>
              For this publication workshop, we’ll focus on translating the five
              senses into language as a way of strengthening (and eventually
              self-publishing) our writing. We’ll look at examples of writing
              that translate smell, sound, visual art, etc., and we’ll also read
              literary and linguistic translators writing about the art of
              translation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Translators are people who think a lot about language — its
              material, its melody — and about how a translation is never just a
              copy, it is always something new, always a collaboration. We’ll
              take our cues from them as we pay attention to the rhythm,
              cadence, structure, and voice of our own writing. We’ll also see
              what happens when the original or source is not a text but a
              sensation — how that might push up against the limits of language,
              or require a new use of it…
            </p>
            <p>Does that make sense?</p>

              We — Meg and Laurel — have long been interested in what arises
              when you translate across the senses.
            </p>
            <p>
              As an art and design writer, Meg thinks a lot about writing that
              is in conversation with visual art. As an artist and web designer,
              Laurel enjoys understanding something anew through rendering it in
              a new form and sharing it. We both love attempting to

                >describe</a

              and

                >imagine</a

              scent. Together, we’ve had many conversations about how
              translation across the senses can bring a new level of awareness
              to language and art.

            <p>
              Meg: When I started working on a past seminar about translation
              and the senses, I sent you the syllabus to look over because I
              knew you had been thinking about similar subjects...
            </p>
            <!-- <p>Laurel:</p>
            <p>
              Meg: When I talk about pictures in my mind I am talking, quite
              specifically, about images that shimmer around the edges... Look
              hard enough, and you can't miss the shimmer. It's there. You can't
              think too much about these pictures that shimmer. You just lie low
              and let them develop. — Joan Didion

              translation became really interesting for you? Why? What were you
              doing at the time? -->
            <p>
              Laurel: I was honored you asked me about it. I remember we talked
              about how artists are sensitive to the world, and that’s what
              makes them good receivers and translators of material, or the
              essence or spirit of things. Sometimes I call this “<a

            </p>
            <p>
              Laurel: Good question. Maybe it was being in art school and
              feeling a pressure around constant invention. I realized that I
              could translate something into a new format as a way of honoring
              it; I like to think of this as subconscious invention. Similar to
              drawing or painting a still life — without even trying, every
              person’s translation will be different. We are all unique filters
              of experience.

            <p>
              An interesting thing about art, too, is that a translation can
              come from an invisible place. That is, how do we translate an
              image that somehow appears into our minds? There’s this Joan
              Didion quote you shared with me...
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              When I talk about pictures in my mind I am talking, quite
              specifically, about images that shimmer around the edges... Look
              hard enough, and you can't miss the shimmer. It’s there. You can't
              think too much about these pictures that shimmer. You just lie low
              and let them develop.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Meg: Right, that quote helped inform my class about writing as
              image-making — in honoring Didion’s quote, I gave the class the
              subtitle “<a
                href="https://www.are.na/meg-miller/shimmer-around-the-edges-writing-as-image-making"
                target="_blank"
                >shimmer around the edges</a
              >.”
            </p>
            <p>How does translation show up in your teaching now?</p>
            <p>
              Laurel: I like to weave translation into all parts of my classes,
              since it not only helps people feel comfortable by giving them a
              clear mission, but I also understand translation as the basis of
              all art-making — sometimes, as you shared, it’s about translating
              some vision, feeling, or shimmer...

              ( &nbsp;&nbsp;What is the class format?&nbsp;&nbsp; )
            </p>
            <p>
              The workshop meets for ten sessions over the course of five weeks.
              Sessions happen on Sunday evenings (7-8pm) virtually for reading
              discussion, and Monday evenings (6-9pm) for exercises, sharing
              work, and publication making. Specific dates: 6.15, 6.16, 6.22,
              6.23, 6.29, 6.30, 7.6, 7.7, 7.13, 7.14.

              ( &nbsp;&nbsp;Can I participate remotely?&nbsp;&nbsp; )
            </p>
            <p>
              This summer, we are prioritizing for in-person participants, but
              down the line we would like to offer this virtually. Please email
              mail@ultralight.school to share any interest in virtual
              participation.

            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
              Yes, there are two half-priced slots available for individuals who
              need help funding the class.

              ( &nbsp;&nbsp;Who might be good for this class?&nbsp;&nbsp; )
            </p>
            <p>
              We imagine this class is ideal for anyone who is interested in
              multisensorial experience and would like to evolve their writing
              practices. Or, maybe you'd like to simply have fun writing through
              translating the senses this summer. The class will end in a group
              publication, so it's also a good way to gain experience in that
              realm. We would like to form a complementary and supportive group
              (please see our
              <a href="../../transmissions/code-of-conduct/">code of conduct</a
              >), so we welcome anyone with specific perspectives and/or skills
              who are also excited to witness and encourage others’ writing
              experiments and publication efforts.
