            In our class, we explored translation and the senses. For over the
            course of five weeks (for the five senses) in June and July, we
            read, discussed, and workshopped our own writings...

            <!-- . How can a
            fragrance become a poem? What are the different ways to write an
            image, or to document a sound? Ursula K. Le Guin says, “all writing
            is translation” — from the perceptual into language. Similarly, we
            looked toward the senses to expand our use of language and to
            strengthen our writing voices. Now that it's the end of the class,
            we collected and published some of our experiments into a
            publication, which we are excited to share this Friday. -->

            We explored questions like: How can a fragrance become a poem? What
            are the different ways to write an image, or to document a sound? Or
            to convey pressure, pain, or touch?
