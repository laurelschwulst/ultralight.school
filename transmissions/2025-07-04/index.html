          <h4>"Becoming Company" — a lecture and workshop by Min Guhong</h4>

          <p>
            We are announcing our first pop-up ( 1 ) lecture and ( 2 ) workshop,
            inspired by the arrival of Min Guhong Manufacturing, a fictional but
            operational one-person company, to NYC all the way from Seoul, South
            Korea...
          </p>
          <p>
            The ( 1 ) lecture will happen on Tuesday, July 8 at 7pm *prompt* at
            O-R-G (38 Ludlow Street, Basement). You can

            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ( 2 ) workshop will happen the following day on Wednesday, July
            9 at from 7-9pm at SVA MFA Interaction Design (136 West 21st Street,
            3rd Floor) in which Min Guhong and Laurel Schwulst will guide you in
            writing your own company into being through text, structure, and
            maybe even a tiny website. You can get tickets and

              >Min Guhong Manufacturing</a
            >, and what does this mysterious entity have to do with Ultralight
            School?
          </p>
          <p>
            A while ago, Laurel (who began Ultralight School)
            <a
              href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/editor-and-ceo-min-guhong-on-introducing-your-company/"
              target="_blank"
              >interviewed Min about introducing your own company</a
            >
            — how a company can be a therapeutic tool for living, the complex
            appeal of products, the guiding quality of names, and embracing
            conventions to explore modern life...
          </p>
          <p>
            The lecture will introduce how Min Guhong has become his own company
            — MGMFG (Min Guhong Maunfacturing). And in the workshop, you’ll
            invent a company of your own. But this isn’t just play. “A company
            is one of the most precise structures for talking about yourself,”
            says Min Guhong.
