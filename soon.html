            <p>Hi everyone,</p>
            <p>
              This summer 2025, beginning in June, we are hosting a few exciting
              classes based physically in NYC!
            </p>
            <p>
              This is happening under a new educational umbrella project called
              “<a href="https://ultralight.school">ultralight.school</a>” (and
              also the website you are on right now) — which we will share more
              about momentarily; but first, the classes, which all encourage
              creative practice and research:
            </p>
            <p>***</p>
            <p>Our summer 2025 classes:</p>
            <p>
              TWA: Total Work of Art — In this 7 week class, meeting on Thursday
              evenings and Sunday afternoons in June, July, and part of August,
              participants come in with one core concept (“point of departure”)
              and shapeshift it through multiple modalities: 1) digital, 2)
              physical, and 3) temporal. Inspired by wide-ranging examples of
              design as world-building — think Bauhaus, Beyoncé, Bernadette
              Corporation — this class responds to how culture is experienced
              today, inviting participants to develop across multiple forms,
              points, and moments of access. This class is taught by Bryant
              Wells, Stephen Kwok, and Laurel Schwulst and hosted at telos.haus
              in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sense to Sense — In this 5 week class, meeting on Sunday evenings
              and Monday evenings in June and July, participants explore
              translation and the senses through writing exercises and a final
              group publication. We’ll also engage in readings and discussion
              about the five senses and what it means to carry sensations over
              into written form. How can a fragrance become a poem? What are the
              different ways to write an image, or to document a sound? This
              class is taught by Meg Miller and Laurel Schwulst and hosted in
              Boerum Hill, Brooklyn.
            </p>
            <p>
              Walking the Internet — In this 3 week class, we will meet three
              consecutive Saturday afternooons in July to explore physical and
              cultural infrastructure in New York City. How does one “see” the
              internet, anyway? Through walking plus some supplemental readings
              and dialogue, we will explore how the internet is not some
              ethereal, untouchable thing, but physically rooted — connected by
              underwater submarine cables and served from data centers
              containing many literal computers worldwide. This class is taught
              by Alex Wolfe and Laurel Schwulst and begins in different places
              in Manhattan each week.
            </p>
            <p>(Stay tuned for applications opening next week.)</p>
            <p>***</p>
            <p>So what is Ultralight School, anyway?</p>

              Speaking of strawberries, Ultralight School is a next evolution of
              <a href="https://fruitful.school">Fruitful School</a> (2020–24),
              which explored how contemporary artistic practices engaged with
              the world wide web or technology at large.

              Initiated by Laurel Schwulst,
              <a href="https://ultralight.school">Ultralight School</a> (Summer
              2025) is rooted in Laurel’s research around the word “<a

                target="_blank"

              — and what lightness means from literal and literary points of
              view, which both support growing artistic practices.
            </p>
            <p>***</p>
            <p>Let’s look at the word “ultralight” in some detail:</p>
            <p>
              Ultralight — Ultralight is a word that means extremely
              lightweight.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ultra — The prefix “ultra-” can mean “very” or “extremely.” And it
              also means “on the other side of” or “beyond.” For example, the
              word “ultraviolet” is “light beyond the visible spectrum,” and
              “ultrasound” is “sound waves or vibrations of a frequency beyond
              what human ears can hear.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Light — In the word “ultralight,” the suffix “-light” refers to
              weight. For instance, the word ultralight is shorthand for a
              <a
                href="https://www.eaa.org/eaa/aviation-interests/ultralights"
                target="_blank"
                >lightweight aircraft</a
              >. Ultralight also describes a genre of lightweight backpacking
              equipment (<a
                href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/"
                target="_blank"
                >r/Ultralight</a
              >) which ideally makes your journey less burdensome.
            </p>
            <p>***</p>
            <p>
              When applied to artistic and research-based practices today, we
              believe “ultralight” can be a helpful guide —
            </p>
            <p>
              Historically, design and art styles are largely a result of the
              limitations and powers of the technology available at that time.
              There are ways of making have been lost in the quest to modernize
              everything. Inspired by the literal definition of ultralight, we
              wonder: How can working with intentional limits enable us to
              create in nourishing ways for ourselves, our audiences, and our
              environments?
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, when taken from a more literary or metaphorical
              vantage, lightness can be about seeing the world in a new way:

                  have to change my approach, look at the world from a different
                  perspective, with a different logic and with fresh methods of

              Ultralight School’s symbol is a sunbeam emanating in all
              directions from an invisible house. Similarly, ultralight is about
              different ways of experiencing something. This summer, we are
              exploring this through 3 classes: “TWA: Total Work of Art”
              encourages shapeshifting a project across multiple points of
              access. “Sense to Sense” is about multisensorial translation. And
              in “Walking the Internet,” we learn about the internet in a new
              way: through physicality and movement.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is not to say that heaviness does not also have its merits.
              Life is about balance — “light” is only possible because of
              “heavy,” and vice versa.
            </p>
            <p>***</p>
            <p>
              Note that our classes this summer are all in-person in New York
              City. If they go well, we may explore some virtual classses or
              aspects in the future. For now, we want to start locally, but do
              let us know if you’d take a virtual class! This is a beginning.
