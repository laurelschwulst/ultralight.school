            Since we all come from different backgrounds and want to create a
            safe and open environment for learning and collaboration, we wanted
            to share a code of conduct to better interact with each other as
            participants and teachers.

            <li>open and free</li>
            <li>suspending judgement</li>
            <li>building on each other’s ideas</li>
            <li>not afraid to share an honest opinion or risky idea</li>
            <li>sharing often while also respecting others’ time to share</li>
            <li>always trying to help each other create their best work</li>

            In the context of reading discussions, we recommend reading assigned
            pieces before meeting and bringing your curiosities and questions.
            Please read actively — marking passages, writing down quotes and
            reflections, and recording questions as they arise — and come
            prepared to share those. When we discuss, you don’t have to share
            anything profound. The idea is simply to share our individual
            reading experiences so we all understand the readings better
            together.
