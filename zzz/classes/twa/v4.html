              In “TWA: Total Work of Art,” we invite artists, designers,
              writers, programmers, and anyone else interested to shapeshift
              their concept across three modalities: 1) digital, 2) physical,
              and 3) temporal. Inspired by wide-ranging examples of design as
              world-building — think Bauhaus, Beyoncé, Bernadette Corporation —
              this workshop responds to how culture is experienced today,
              inviting participants to develop a core concept across multiple
              forms and points of access.
            </p>
            <p>
              This 7 week workshop is led by three teachers: Stephen Kwok,
              Laurel Schwulst, and Bryant Wells. Meeting twice a week (on
              Thursdays and Sundays), each session includes conversational
              lectures, technical demonstrations, presentation and critique
              time, and guest visits. The workshop culminates in a public event
              in which the participants present the totality of their work.

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
              Our idea for this course began with three disparate references:
            </p>
            <!-- <p>
            A graduate studio art course Stephen took at School of the Art
            Institute of Chicago called Shapeshifters, the business-world
            concept of touchpoints, and a quote by Christopher Alexander about
            increasing surface area of a strawberry.
          </p> -->
            <p>
              1 ) <i>Shapeshifters</i> was a class Stephen took at the School of
              the Art Institute of Chicago. Taught by Frederic Moffet, it
              invited students to create works for three predetermined moments
              of presentation: a screening, an exhibition, and an evening of
              performance. Within this bare but demanding structure, students
              were given the opportunity to realize a dynamic and
              multidisciplinary bodies of work alongside each other.
            </p>
            <p>
              2 ) <i>Touchpoints</i> is a marketing concept which refers to the
              various modalities through which consumers interact with a brand.
              Examples of touchpoints include advertisements, social media
              posts, in-store experiences, and encounters with customer service
              representatives. Marketing professionals commonly believe that
              such touchpoints shape consumers’ brand perception and purchasing
              decisions throughout the conventionally defined decision-making
              process: before, during, and after purchase.
            </p>
            <p>
              3 ) In his book <i>A Timeless Way of Building</i>, the architect
              and design theorist Christopher Alexander shares: “The finer I
              slice the strawberries, the more surfaces there are; the more
              surfaces there are, the more it tastes.” Through increasing
              surface area, generously considering entries, exits, and traversal
              patterns, an idea becomes more accessible — open to air.
            </p>
            <p>
              All three frameworks encourage a medium and discipline agnostic
              approach to making.
            </p>
            <p>
              What if we adopted these approaches for our own projects? What if
              we start with the interplay between modalities, rather than
              needing a single form to contain the essence of a work? What if
              there is no “primary” way to experience something anymore?
            </p>

            <h2>TWA: Total Work of Art</h2>

            <p>TWA: Total Work of Art “Total Work of Art” entered the chat.</p>
            <p>
              According to Wikipedia, a
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesamtkunstwerk"
                >Gesamtkunstwerk</a
              >
              can mean a “total work of art,” a “universal artwork,” or a
              “synthesis of the arts.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Richard Wagner, a composer known primarily for his operas,
              popularized the term throughout his career which explored
              combining musical, visual, and dramatic art into an all-embracing
              theatrical whole.
            </p>
            <p>
              As described in Fred Turner's book <i>The Democratic Surround</i>,
              artist and Bauhaus art school educator László Moholy-Nagy argued
              that design schools offer the kind of training that would
              strengthen individual American character and American society as a
              whole in the face of fascism in a 1940 article titled “Relating
              the Parts to the Whole” —
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              “WE NEED IN LARGE NUMBERS a new type of person — one who sees the
              periphery as well as the immediate, and who can integrate his
              special job with the great whole of which it is a small part. This
              ability is a matter of everyday efficiency. It will also
              contribute to building a better culture.”
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              Suddenly, examples appeared everywhere, from Bauhaus and Corbusier
              to Beyoncé’s Lemonade and Kpop, Catholic Mass, it seemed as if
              there were no piece of culture in 2025 that didn’t have
              simultaneous physical, digital, and temporally-based modes of
              encounter. As our understanding of what could be considered
              gesamtkunstwerk expanded, so did our curiosity about what
              reconsidering this art historical concept in today’s climate might
              provoke. As our understanding of what could be considered
              Gesamtkunstwerk expanded, so did our curiosity about (the
              political / creative provocations of) what reconsidering this art
              historical concept might do today. How can we make a new form of
              gesamtkunstwerk today in 2025? We call it “TWA.”

              of Design and the Yale Graphic Design MFA.
