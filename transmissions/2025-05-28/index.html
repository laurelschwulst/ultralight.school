          <p>Hi everyone,</p>
          <p>
            We’ve received a few inquiries for a little more time to apply to
            our classes, so we are extending the deadline through the weekend.
            So applications are now due on Sunday, June 1 at 11:59pm EST.

            In the meantime, we’ve also been working on “living bibliographies”
            for our classes through
            <a
              href="https://www.are.na/ultralight-school-backpack"
              target="_blank"
              >Are.na</a
            >. We recognize that we, as teachers of these classes, are merely
            singular nodes within a much more expansive and ongoing
            conversation. That said, our bibliographies for these classes —
            <a
              href="https://www.are.na/ultralight-school-backpack/bibliography-for-twa-total-work-of-art"
              target="_blank"
              >TWA</a
            >
            and
            <a
              href="https://are.na/ultralight-school-backpack/bibliography-for-sense-to-sense"
              target="_blank"
              >Sense to Sense</a
            >
            — are open research channels, meaning that if you have a reading,
            reference, idea, etc. that’s relevant to our class themes, you are
            welcome to share.
            <!-- (We’ve also posted excerpts of these on our
            <a href="https://instagram.com/library_of_light" target="_blank"></a
            >IG.) -->
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, if you have a question, just send us an email — you can
            reach the teachers at: twa@ultralight.school and/or
            sense-to-sense@ultralight.school. We are happy to chat!
