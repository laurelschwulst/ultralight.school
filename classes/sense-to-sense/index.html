        Sense to Sense is a publishing workshop about translation and the
        senses. Over five weeks, participants will engage in readings and
        discussion about the five senses and explore what it means to carry
        sensations over into written form. How can a fragrance become a poem?
        What are the different ways to write an image, or to document a sound?
        If as Ursula Le Guin says, “all writing is translation,” from the
        perceptual into language, we’ll look toward the senses to expand our use
        of language, to break us out of writing ruts, and to strengthen our
        writing voice. By the end of class, we’ll collect and publish some of
        our writing experiments in a publication. If we’re feeling adventurous,
        we may also translation the publication into different modalities and
        mediums — audio, video, web, etc…
      </p>
      <p>
        This class happens two consecutive days of the week (Sunday & Monday)
        for five weeks. We’ll meet: 1) Virtually on Sundays for one hour reading
        discussions, 2) In-person in Brooklyn, NY on Mondays for three hours of
        exercises, sharing work, and publication making.
