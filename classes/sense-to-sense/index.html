              Sense to Sense is a publishing class about translation and the
              senses. Over five weeks, participants will engage in readings and
              discussion about the five senses and explore what it means to
              carry sensations over into written form. How can a fragrance
              become a poem? What are the different ways to write an image, or
              to document a sound? Ursula K. Le Guin says, “all writing is
              translation” — from the perceptual into language. Similarly, we’ll
              look toward the senses to expand our use of language and to
              strengthen our writing voices. By the end of class, we’ll collect
              and publish some of our experiments into a publication.
              <!-- , and possibly translate this publication, which we’re
              curious to explore in different mediums as well — audio, video,
              web, etc… -->
            </p>
            <p>
              This class is taught by Meg Miller & Laurel Schwulst and happens
              two consecutive days of the week (Sunday & Monday) for five weeks.
              We’ll meet: 1) Virtually on Sundays for one hour reading
              discussions, 2) In-person in Brooklyn, NY on Mondays for three
              hours of exercises, sharing work, and publication making.
            </p>

              Note: We designed this class for in person, but depending on
              demand we’re open to opening a hybrid option. If you are
              interested in the class but you’re not in New York City, write us:

            <h2 class="sense-underline">Background</h2>
            <p>
              Translation is traditionally understood as between languages — in
              <i>The Philosophy of Translation</i>, Damion Searls traces
              translation back to its Latin root <i>translatio</i>, meaning “to
              carry across.” The Renaissance later introduced <i>traductio</i>,
              or <i>traduction</i>, shifting the emphasis from simple transport
              to a holistic transformation — one that preserves the essence, or
              soul, of the original in an entirely new form. Walter Benjamin, in
              <i>The Task of the Translator</i>, similarly suggests that
              translation is not about equivalence but transformation, a process
              that illuminates the original by placing it in a new constellation
              of meaning.
            </p>
            <p>
              Artists, in many ways, are natural translators. Art makes the
              world unfamiliar so we can see it anew. Artists are naturally
              sensitive and attuned to enchantment, estrangement, and sensation
              — qualities that make them skilled at transmitting meaning across
              boundaries.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our class name, “Sense to Sense,” is a play on the term
              “sense-for-sense translation.” This is an approach to translation
              that prioritizes transmitting the overall meaning of the text — as
              opposed to “word-for-word translation,” a literal translation of
              every word. It’s the oldest norm for translation, stretching back
              to Cicero.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this context, “sense” is of course referring to a
              <i>meaning conveyed or intended</i>. But we couldn’t help but
              think about that other definition of “sense,” the one referring to
              smell, sight, hearing, taste, and touch.
            </p>

            <p>
              For this publication class, we’ll focus on translating the five
              senses into language as a way of strengthening (and eventually
              self-publishing) our writing. We’ll look at examples of writing
              that translate smell, sound, visual art, etc., and we’ll also read
              literary and linguistic translators writing about the art of
              translation.

              Translators are people who think a lot about language — its
              material, its melody — and about how a translation is never just a
              copy, it is always something new, always a collaboration. We’ll
              take our cues from them as we pay attention to the rhythm,
              cadence, structure, and voice of our own writing. We’ll also see
              what happens when the original or source is not a text but a
              sensation — how that might push up against the limits of language,
              or require a new use of it…

              We — Meg and Laurel — have long been interested in what arises
              when you translate across the senses.
            </p>
            <p>
              As an art and design writer, Meg thinks a lot about writing that
              is in conversation with visual art. As an artist and web designer,
              Laurel enjoys understanding something anew through rendering it in
              a new form and sharing it. We

              attempting to describe scent. Together, we’ve had many
              conversations about how translation across the senses can bring
              new awareness to language and art.

            <p>
              Meg: When I started working on a past seminar about translation
              and the senses, I sent you the syllabus to look over because I
              knew you had been thinking about similar subjects...

              Meg: When I talk about pictures in my mind I am talking, quite
              specifically, about images that shimmer around the edges... Look
              hard enough, and you can't miss the shimmer. It's there. You can't
              think too much about these pictures that shimmer. You just lie low
              and let them develop. — Joan Didion

            <p>
              Laurel: I was honored you asked me about it. I remember we talked

              makes them good receivers and translators of material, or the

            <p>
              Laurel: Good question. Maybe it was being in art school and
              feeling a pressure around constant invention. I realized that I
              could translate something into a new format as a way of honoring
              it; I like to think of this as subconscious invention. Similar to
              drawing or painting a still life — without even trying, every
              person’s translation will be different. We are all unique filters
              of experience.

            <p>
              An interesting thing about art, too, is that a translation can
              come from an invisible place. That is, how do we translate an
              image that somehow appears into our minds? There’s that Joan
              Didion quote you shared with me, from her piece “<a

                target="_blank"

            <p>
              Meg: Right, that quote helped inform my class about writing as
              image-making — after Didion’s quote, I gave the class the subtitle
              “<a
                href="https://www.are.na/meg-miller/shimmer-around-the-edges-writing-as-image-making"

            <p>How does translation show up in your teaching now?</p>
            <p>
              Laurel: I like to weave translation into all parts of my classes,
              since it not only helps people feel comfortable by giving them a
              clear mission, but I also understand translation as the basis of
              all art-making...

              publication called
              <a href="https://sensenoteverything.zip/" target="_blank"
                ><i>Say Sense Is Not Everything</i></a
              >. The title came from Sawako Nakayasu’s
              <a href="https://www.are.na/block/27791091" target="_blank"
                ><i>Say Translation Is Art</i></a
              >, which you introduced us to, and their pieces were about
              translation and the senses, but also about the untranslatable.
              Ultimately, all of the writings in the book were lovely examples
              of how circling around the thing can bring us closer to the
              essence and truth of the experience than saying it directly.

              I love making group publications because, one, I think
              publications are a way of creating a social body — it’s a thing to
              organize around — and, two, it really does something to see your
              work published. In the writing-as-image-making class we made a
              book called

            <h2 class="sense-underline">FAQ</h2>
            <p class="question">
              ( &nbsp;&nbsp;What is the class format?&nbsp;&nbsp; )
            </p>
            <p>
              The class meets for ten sessions over the course of five weeks.
              Sessions happen on Sunday evenings (7-8pm) virtually for reading
              discussion, and Monday evenings (6-9pm) for exercises, sharing
              work, and publication making. Specific dates: 6.15, 6.16, 6.22,
              6.23, 6.29, 6.30, 7.6, 7.7, 7.13, 7.14.
            </p>

            <p class="question">
              ( &nbsp;&nbsp;Can I participate remotely?&nbsp;&nbsp; )
            </p>
            <p>
              We designed this class to be in-person, but if there is sizable
              interest from people outside of New York City, we are open to
              creating a hybrid option. If you would like to take the class but
              cannot be there in person, please email
              sense-to-sense@ultralight.school to let us know.
            </p>

            <p class="question">
              ( &nbsp;&nbsp;What materials do I need?&nbsp;&nbsp; )
            </p>
            <p>
              Something to write and design with. Some prefer notebooks and
              pen/paper, others laptops.
            </p>

            <p class="question">
              ( &nbsp;&nbsp;Are there scholarships available?&nbsp;&nbsp; )
            </p>
            <p>
              Yes, there are two half-priced slots available for individuals who
              need help funding the class.
            </p>
            <p class="question">
              ( &nbsp;&nbsp;Who might be good for this class?&nbsp;&nbsp; )
            </p>
            <p>
              We imagine this class is ideal for anyone who is interested in
              multi-sensorial experience and would like to evolve their writing
              practices. Or, maybe you'd like to simply have fun writing through
              translating the senses this summer. The class will end in a group
              publication, so it's also a good way to gain experience having
              your work published. Additionally, we would like to form a
              complementary and supportive group (please see our
              <a href="../../transmissions/code-of-conduct/">code of conduct</a
              >), so we welcome anyone with specific perspectives and/or skills
              who are excited to witness and encourage others’ writing
              experiments and publication efforts.
