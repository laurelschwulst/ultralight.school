            As a reminder, these are three walks exploring physical and cultural
            infrastructure in NYC. They are led by writer Alex Wolfe and designer Laurel
            Schwulst.
        </p>
        <p>Background — Most of us experience the internet through screens, browsers, and apps — layers of interface that make the internet feel abstract, even invisible. Yet beneath our feet and above our heads lie the often-overlooked systems that allow it to function. Alex and Laurel have been inspired by Ingrid Burrington's book <i>Networks of New York: An Illustrated Field Guide to Urban Internet Infrastructure</i> and artists who embrace meandering and drifting — in both physical and digital realms. <a
              href="../../classes/walking-the-internet/index.html"
              >More background on this series here</a>.
          </p>
          <p>Participants — We imagine these walks are best for people who have a strong interest in the hidden systems that allow the world to function and are also open to hybrid event structures. Participants should be comfortable walking distances up to 5 miles in potentially hot and humid weather typical during NYC summers.
            </p>
            <p>Materials — Please wear comfortable walking shoes. Bring sun protection and plenty of water, as it will likely be hot and humid. Note taking materials are encouraged.
          </p>
          <p>Fee — The walks operate on a pay-what-you-can basis. At the end of the walk, you can pay whatever you feel the walk was worth (cash or card both accepted). Most participants choose to pay between $40-$60 per person.</p>
