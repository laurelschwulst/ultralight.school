          <p>Hi everyone,</p>
          <p>
            This summer 2025, beginning in June, we are hosting a few exciting
            classes based physically in NYC!
          </p>
          <p>
            This is happening under a new educational umbrella project called
            “<a href="https://ultralight.school">ultralight.school</a>” (and
            also the website you are on right now) — which we will share more
            about momentarily; but first, the classes, which all encourage
            creative practice and research:
          </p>
          <p>***</p>
          <p>Our summer 2025 classes:</p>
          <p>
            TWA: Total Work of Art — In this 7 week class, meeting on Thursday
            evenings and Sunday afternoons in June, July, and part of August,
            participants come in with one core concept (“point of departure”)
            and shapeshift it through multiple modalities: 1) digital, 2)
            physical, and 3) temporal. Inspired by wide-ranging examples of
            design as world-building — think Bauhaus, Beyoncé, Bernadette
            Corporation — this class responds to how culture is experienced
            today, inviting participants to develop across multiple forms,
            points, and moments of access. This class is taught by Bryant Wells,
            Stephen Kwok, and Laurel Schwulst and hosted at telos.haus in East
            Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
            <!-- <i>This class is launching soon, stay tuned.</i> -->

          <p>
            Sense to Sense — In this 5 week class, meeting on Sunday evenings
            and Monday evenings in June and July, participants explore
            translation and the senses through writing exercises and a final
            group publication. We’ll also engage in readings and discussion
            about the five senses and what it means to carry sensations over
            into written form. How can a fragrance become a poem? What are the
            different ways to write an image, or to document a sound? This class
            is taught by Meg Miller and Laurel Schwulst and hosted in Boerum
            Hill, Brooklyn. (This class is launching soon, stay tuned.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Walking the Internet — In this 3 week class, we will meet three
            consecutive Saturday afternooons in July to explore physical and
            cultural infrastructure in New York City. How does one “see” the
            internet, anyway? Through walking plus some supplemental readings
            and dialogue, we will explore how the internet is not some ethereal,
            untouchable thing, but physically rooted — connected by underwater
            submarine cables and served from data centers containing many
            literal computers worldwide. This class is taught by Alex Wolfe and
            Laurel Schwulst and begins in different places in Manhattan each
            week. (This class is launching soon, stay tuned.)

            Speaking of strawberries, Ultralight School is a next evolution of
            <a href="https://fruitful.school">Fruitful School</a> (2020–24),
            which explored how contemporary artistic practices engaged with the
            world wide web or technology at large.

            <a href="https://ultralight.school">Ultralight School</a> (Summer
            2025) is rooted in Laurel’s research around the word “<a

              target="_blank"

            — and what lightness means from literal and literary points of view,
            which both support growing artistic practices.
          </p>
          <p>***</p>
          <p>Let’s look at the word “ultralight” in some detail:</p>
          <p>
            Ultralight — Ultralight is a word that means extremely lightweight.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultra — The prefix “ultra-” can mean “very” or “extremely.” And it
            also means “on the other side of” or “beyond.” For example, the word
            “ultraviolet” is “light beyond the visible spectrum,” and
            “ultrasound” is “sound waves or vibrations of a frequency beyond
            what human ears can hear.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Light — In the word “ultralight,” the suffix “-light” refers to
            weight. For instance, the word ultralight is shorthand for a
            <a
              href="https://www.eaa.org/eaa/aviation-interests/ultralights"
              target="_blank"
              >lightweight aircraft</a
            >. Ultralight also describes a genre of lightweight backpacking
            equipment (<a
              href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/"
              target="_blank"
              >r/Ultralight</a
            >) which ideally makes your journey less burdensome.
          </p>
          <p>***</p>
          <p>
            When applied to artistic and research-based practices today, we
            believe “ultralight” can be a helpful guide —
          </p>
          <p>
            Historically, design and art styles are largely a result of the
            limitations and powers of the technology available at that time.
            There are ways of making have been lost in the quest to modernize
            everything. Inspired by the literal definition of ultralight, we
            wonder: How can working with intentional limits enable us to create
            in nourishing ways for ourselves, our audiences, and our
            environments?
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, when taken from a more literary or metaphorical
            vantage, lightness can be about seeing the world in a new way:
          </p>

                >“Whenever humanity seems condemned to heaviness, I think I
                should fly like Perseus into a different space. I don’t mean
                escaping into dreams or into the irrational. I mean that I have
                to change my approach, look at the world from a different
                perspective, with a different logic and with fresh methods of
                cognition and verification...”</i

          <p>
            In this way, ultralight embraces different ways of experiencing
            something — utilizing multiple mediums, senses, and ways of being.
            Translating something into new forms often helps us understand its
            primary essence better, anyway. Through this, we can increase
            surface area for entry, rendering something more accessible to
            different audiences and contexts. And in today’s fragmented
            information landscape, this light-handed, flexible, shapeshifting
            approach often works well — as there are no longer primary ways of
            experiencing anything.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is not to say that heaviness does not also have its merits.
            Life is about balance — “light” is only possible because of “heavy,”
            and vice versa. In an ultralight world, we must anchor to some
            gravity: something true worth returning to. This might be our “point
            of departure,” a mantra, a core concept — something timeless to us.
            Or maybe it’s less a thing and rather an ongoing way of being...

            Ultralight School’s symbol is a sunbeam emanating in all directions
            from an invisible house. Relatedly, this summer, we are exploring
            multiple entrances into unique worlds through 3 classes: “TWA: Total
            Work of Art” encourages shapeshifting a project across multiple
            forms and points of access. “Sense to Sense” is about translating
            sensorial experiences into writing and publication. And in “Walking
            the Internet,” we learn about the internet in a new way: through
            physicality and movement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that our classes this summer are all in-person in New York
            City. If they go well, we may explore some virtual classses or
            aspects later. For now, we want to begin locally — but do let us
            know if you’d take a virtual class! This is a beginning.
