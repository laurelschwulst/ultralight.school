              In “TWA: Total Work of Art” we invite artists, designers, writers,
              programmers, and anyone else interested to shapeshift their
              concept across three modalities: 1) digital, 2) physical, and 3)
              temporal. Inspired by wide-ranging examples of design as
              world-building — think Bauhaus, Beyoncé, Bernadette Corporation —
              this class responds to how culture is experienced today, inviting
              participants to develop a core concept across multiple points and
              moments of access.
            </p>
            <p>
              This 7 week class is led by three teachers: Stephen Kwok, Laurel
              Schwulst, and Bryant Wells. Meeting twice a week (on Thursdays and
              Sundays), each session includes conversational lectures, technical
              demonstrations, presentation and critique time, and guest visits.
              The class culminates in a public event in which the participants
              present the totality of their work.

            <h2 class="rainbow-underline">Background</h2>

            <p>Our idea for this class began with two references:</p>
            <p>
              1 ) <i>Shapeshifters</i> was a class Stephen took at the School of
              the Art Institute of Chicago. Taught by Frederic Moffet, it
              invited students to create works for three predetermined moments
              of presentation: a screening, an exhibition, and an evening of
              performance. Within this bare but demanding structure, students
              were given the opportunity to realize a dynamic and
              multidisciplinary bodies of work alongside each other.
            </p>
            <p>
              2 ) <i>Touchpoints</i> is a marketing concept which refers to the
              various modalities through which consumers interact with a brand.
              Examples of touchpoints include advertisements, social media
              posts, in-store experiences, and encounters with customer service
              representatives. Marketing professionals commonly believe that
              such touchpoints shape consumers’ brand perception and purchasing
              decisions throughout the conventionally defined decision-making
              process: before, during, and after purchase.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both frameworks encourage a medium and discipline agnostic
              approach to making. What if we adopted these approaches for our
              own projects? What if we start with the interplay between
              modalities, rather than needing a single form to contain the
              essence of a work? What if there is no “primary” way to experience
              something anymore?
            </p>

              According to Wikipedia, a
              <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesamtkunstwerk"
                target="_blank"
                >Gesamtkunstwerk</a
              >
              can mean a “total work of art,” a “universal artwork,” or a
              “synthesis of the arts.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Richard Wagner, a composer known primarily for his operas,
              popularized the term throughout his career which explored
              combining musical, visual, and dramatic art into an all-embracing
              theatrical whole.
            </p>
            <p>
              As described in Fred Turner's book <i>The Democratic Surround</i>,
              artist and Bauhaus art school educator László Moholy-Nagy argued
              that design schools offer the kind of training that would
              strengthen individual American character and American society as a
              whole in the face of fascism in a 1940 article titled “Relating
              the Parts to the Whole” —
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              “WE NEED IN LARGE NUMBERS a new type of person — one who sees the
              periphery as well as the immediate, and who can integrate his
              special job with the great whole of which it is a small part. This
              ability is a matter of everyday efficiency. It will also
              contribute to building a better culture.”
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Suddenly, examples appeared everywhere, from Bauhaus and Corbusier
              to Beyoncé’s Lemonade and Kpop, Catholic Mass, it seemed as if
              there were no piece of culture in 2025 that didn’t have
              simultaneous physical, digital, and temporally-based modes of
              encounter. As our understanding of what could be considered
              gesamtkunstwerk expanded, so did our curiosity about what
              reconsidering this art historical concept in today’s climate might
              provoke. As our understanding of what could be considered
              Gesamtkunstwerk expanded, so did our curiosity about (the
              political / creative provocations of) what reconsidering this art
              historical concept might do today. How can we make a new form of
              gesamtkunstwerk today in 2025? We call it “TWA.”

              “Total work of art” has associations of dominance, control,
              spectacle, finality that we don’t feel entirely describes our
              practices. What control is even possible, we ask, in a gig
              economy, where we are required to switch modes, pass between
              contexts, and move between mediums constantly?

              The fragmentation of attention... lack of differentiation... all
              contributes to an increasingly atomized world where it can be
              difficult to make anything with coherence... something solid
              enough to move people...

              But what if we made with air? Air is the gap around and between
              the work you make. At first it might seem like none of it is
              related, but with a little intention you can bring your seemingly
              disparate parts and the spaces between them together. How can you
              make not a work, but an atmosphere?

              It’s a fitting coincidence that TWA is the name of a now defunct
              airline something about it having a hotel now, the legend lives
              on?. Creating in this fashion is no easy task, but it is a
              generative provocation, one that suggests bringing in a ‘total
              work of art’ mindset not to control an outcome, but to encourage a
              process that considers the interplay between things.

              Then, there were the three of us -- artists and designers with
              inherently multi-hypenate practices. There were natural overlaps,
              Stephen working predominantly in performative and event-based
              installation, Laurel in ... and Bryant in... Three designers,
              three forms.

              artist, designer, writer, educator, and technologist interested in

              <a href="https://www.bryantwells.com/">Bryant Wells</a> is a New
              York-based designer who works independently and collaboratively
              with artists, writers, musicians, and institutions to create
              websites, publications, identities, and objects. His practice
              explores the political and cultural effects shaping networked
              communication, and the metaphorical and material implications of
              "what’s in the air.” Bryant teaches design at the Parsons School
              of Design and the Yale Graphic Design MFA.
