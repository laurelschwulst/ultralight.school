        In “TWA: Total Work of Art,” we invite artists, designers, writers,
        programmers, and anyone else interested to shapeshift their concept
        across three modalities: 1) digital, 2) physical, and 3) temporal.
        Inspired by wide-ranging examples of design as world-building — think
        Bauhaus, Beyoncé, Bernadette Corporation — this workshop responds to how
        culture is experienced today, inviting participants to develop a core
        concept across multiple forms and points of access.
      </p>
      <p>
        This 7 week workshop is led by three teachers: Stephen Kwok, Laurel
        Schwulst, and Bryant Wells. Meeting twice a week (on Thursdays and
        Sundays), each session includes conversational lectures, technical
        demonstrations, presentation and critique time, and guest visits. The
        workshop culminates in a public event in which the participants present
        the totality of their work.

      <h2>Background</h2>

      <p>Our idea for this class began with two references:</p>
      <p>
        1 ) <i>Shapeshifters</i> was a class Stephen took at the School of the
        Art Institute of Chicago. Taught by Frederic Moffet, it invited students
        to create works for three predetermined moments of presentation: a
        screening, an exhibition, and an evening of performance. Within this
        bare but demanding structure, students were given the opportunity to
        realize a dynamic and multidisciplinary bodies of work alongside each
        other.
      </p>
      <p>
        2 ) <i>Touchpoints</i> is a marketing concept which refers to the
        various modalities through which consumers interact with a brand.
        Examples of touchpoints include advertisements, social media posts,
        in-store experiences, and encounters with customer service
        representatives. Marketing professionals commonly believe that such
        touchpoints shape consumers’ brand perception and purchasing decisions
        throughout the conventionally defined decision-making process: before,
        during, and after purchase.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both frameworks encourage a medium and discipline agnostic approach to
        making.
      </p>
      <p>
        What if we adopted these approaches for our own projects? What if we
        start with the interplay between modalities, rather than needing a
        single form to contain the essence of a work? What if there is no
        “primary” way to experience something anymore?
      </p>

      <h2>TWA: Total Work of Art</h2>

      <p>“Total Work of Art” entered the chat.</p>
      <p>
        According to Wikipedia, a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesamtkunstwerk" target="_blank"
          >Gesamtkunstwerk</a
        >
        can mean a “total work of art,” a “universal artwork,” or a “synthesis
        of the arts.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Richard Wagner, a composer known primarily for his operas, popularized
        the term throughout his career which explored combining musical, visual,
        and dramatic art into an all-embracing theatrical whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        As described in Fred Turner's book <i>The Democratic Surround</i>,
        artist and Bauhaus art school educator László Moholy-Nagy argued that
        design schools offer the kind of training that would strengthen
        individual American character and American society as a whole in the
        face of fascism in a 1940 article titled “Relating the Parts to the
        Whole” —
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “WE NEED IN LARGE NUMBERS a new type of person — one who sees the
        periphery as well as the immediate, and who can integrate his special
        job with the great whole of which it is a small part. This ability is a
        matter of everyday efficiency. It will also contribute to building a
        better culture.”
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Suddenly, examples appeared everywhere, from Bauhaus and Corbusier to
        Beyoncé’s Lemonade and Kpop, Catholic Mass, it seemed as if there were
        no piece of culture in 2025 that didn’t have simultaneous physical,
        digital, and temporally-based modes of encounter. As our understanding
        of what could be considered gesamtkunstwerk expanded, so did our
        curiosity about what reconsidering this art historical concept in
        today’s climate might provoke. As our understanding of what could be
        considered Gesamtkunstwerk expanded, so did our curiosity about (the
        political / creative provocations of) what reconsidering this art
        historical concept might do today. How can we make a new form of
        gesamtkunstwerk today in 2025? We call it “TWA.”

      <h2>TWA: Thinking with Air</h2>

      <p>
        “Total work of art” has associations of dominance, control, spectacle,
        finality that we don’t feel entirely describes our practices. What
        control is even possible, we ask, in a gig economy, where we are
        required to switch modes, pass between contexts, and move between
        mediums constantly?
      </p>
      <p>
        The fragmentation of attention... lack of differentiation... all
        contributes to an increasingly atomized world where it can be difficult
        to make anything with coherence... something solid enough to move
        people...
      </p>
      <p>
        But what if we made with air? Air is the gap around and between the work
        you make. At first it might seem like none of it is related, but with a
        little intention you can bring your seemingly disparate parts and the
        spaces between them together. How can you make not a work, but an
        atmosphere?
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s a fitting coincidence that TWA is the name of a now defunct airline
        something about it having a hotel now, the legend lives on?. Creating in
        this fashion is no easy task, but it is a generative provocation, one
        that suggests bringing in a ‘total work of art’ mindset not to control
        an outcome, but to encourage a process that considers the interplay
        between things.

        installation, Laurel in ... and Bryant in... Three designers, three
