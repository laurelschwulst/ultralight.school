          <h4>Ultralight Circulation — a waterfall methodology</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            At Ultralight School, we have the special privilege to publish and
            circulate in an ultralight way, or at least aspire to —
          </p>
          <p>***</p>
          <p>
            Here is our waterfall method of publishing, if we have a class,
            event, or update to share:
          </p>
          <p>
            ( 1 ) First, we add the event to our
            <a
              href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=896c39aa11bf441af4d932c1b02aed654ae7dc45b7ef58353e166b92fc295177%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York"
              >Google Calendar</a
            >. Google Calendar is one of the easiest tools to use. It's also one
            of the most ubiquitous and everyday. If anyone has our Google
            Calendar installed, they will be the ones to see our event updates
            first. It's truly an honor to be in the background of one's daily
            activities!
          </p>
          <p>
            ( 2 ) Second, we add the event to our website,
            <a href="https://ultralight.school">ulralight.school</a>, in some
            way. There should be a permalink (that is, a unique page on our
            site) to refer/link to it. Once we create that page, we update the
            Google Calendar event with it, so people can folow it to learn more.
          </p>
          <p>
            ( 3 ) After that, it's about spreading the info through other means,
            in other places, so people will see it — generally going from what
            feels lightest to heaviest.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Are.na — We post to our favorite social media first! Often we
              paste a permalink or take a screenshot and put it in our
              <a
                href="https://www.are.na/ultralight-school-backpack/announcements-6x1cqfmgu0i"
                >Announcements</a
              >
              channel. It's an easy way to check that our link works, in
              addition to sharing the information. Are.na does not have an
              algorithmic feed. It's a good place to be.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Mailing List — We like to send out an
              <a href="https://buttondown.com/ultralight-school"
                >email newsletter</a
              >
              next. This way, our content reaches people in a place they can
              truly focus on it, if they want to. Email inboxes typically allow
              people to mark things as read, sort them into folders, etc. It's a
              more private and intentional space when compared to other places
              on the current internet.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Instagram — We post to our
              <a href="https://www.instagram.com/library_of_light">Instagram</a>
              last. Ideally, there is a significant delay between sharing in our
              newsletter and posting to Instagram. We might not even post to
              Instagram sometimes. This way, we prioritize the people who are
              able to give us their fuller attention in digital ecosystems that
              they have more agency over, rather than scrolling through an
              algorithmic feed like Instagram. At the same time, we are on
              Instagram because that's where people are for some reason.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>***</p>
          <p>
            Our publishing circulation waterfall is a methodology in progress.
            We might adjust it as time goes on, but essentially it helps us both
            be ourselves while still connecting to our audience(s) in ways that
            work for everyone.
