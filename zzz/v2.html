          <summary>May 9, 2025 — Announcing Ultralight School</summary>
          <div class="announcement-itself">
            <p>Hi everyone,</p>

            <p>
              This summer 2025, beginning in June, we are hosting a few exciting
              classes based physically in NYC!
            </p>
            <p>
              This is happening under a new educational umbrella project called
              “<a href="https://ultralight.school">ultralight.school</a>” —
              which we will share more about momentarily; but first, the
              classes:
            </p>
            <p>***</p>
            <p>Our summer 2025 classes:</p>
            <p>
              <b>TWA: Total Work of Art</b> — In this 7 week class, meeting on
              Thursday evenings and Sunday afternoons in June, July, and part of
              August, participants come in with one core concept and shapeshift
              it through multiple modalities: 1) digital, 2) physical, and 3)
              temporal. Inspired by wide-ranging examples of design as
              world-building — think Bauhaus, Beyoncé, Bernadette Corporation —
              this class responds to how culture is experienced today, inviting
              participants to develop a core concept across multiple forms,
              points, and moments of access. This class is taught by Bryant
              Wells, Stephen Kwok, and Laurel Schwulst and hosted at telos.haus
              in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Sense to Sense</b> — In this 5 week class, meeting on Sunday
              evenings and Monday evenings in June and July, participants
              explore translation and the senses through readings, exercises,
              and a final group publication. We’ll engage in readings and
              discussion about the five senses and what it means to carry
              sensations over into written form. How can a fragrance become a
              poem? What are the different ways to write an image, or to
              document a sound? This class is taught by Meg Miller and Laurel
              Schwulst and hosted in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Walking the Internet</b> — In this 3 week class, we will meet
              three consecutive Saturday afternooons in July to explore physical
              infrastructure in New York City. How does one “see” the internet,
              anyway? We will explore how the internet is not some ethereal,
              untouchable thing, but physically rooted — connected by underwater
              submarine cables and served from data centers containing many
              literal computers worldwide. This class is taught by Alex Wolfe
              and Laurel Schwulst and takes place in different places in
              Manhattan each week.
            </p>

              <a href="https://fruitful.school">Fruitful School</a> (2020–24),
              which explored how contemporary artistic practices engaged with
              the world wide web or technology at large.

              Initiated by Laurel Schwulst,
              <a href="https://ultralight.school">Ultralight School</a> (2025–)
              took root in Laurel’s research around the word “<a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTJCPEkQ2RE"
                >ultralight</a

              of view.

              This is not to say that heaviness does not also have its merits.
              Life is about balance — light is only possible because of heavy,
              and vice versa.
