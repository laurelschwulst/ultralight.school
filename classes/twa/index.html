            <p>
              In “TWA: Total Work of Art” we invite artists, designers, writers,
              programmers, and anyone else interested to shapeshift their
              concept across three modalities: 1) digital, 2) physical, and 3)
              temporal. Inspired by wide-ranging examples of design as
              world-building — think Bauhaus, Beyoncé, Bernadette Corporation —
              this class responds to how culture is experienced today, inviting
              participants to develop a core concept across multiple points and
              moments of access.
            </p>
            <p>
              This 7 week class is led by three teachers: Stephen Kwok, Laurel
              Schwulst, and Bryant Wells. Meeting twice a week (on Thursdays and
              Sundays), each session includes conversational lectures, technical
              demonstrations, presentation and critique time — plus some guest visits.
              The class culminates in a public event in which the participants
              present the totality of their work.

            <h2 class="rainbow-underline">Background</h2>

            <p>Our idea for this class began with two references:</p>
            <p>
              1 ) <i>Shapeshifters</i>, a seminar taught by Frederic Moffet at
              the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, invited graduate students
              to create works for three predetermined moments of presentation: a
              screening, an exhibition, and an evening of performance. Within
              this bare but demanding structure, students were challenged to
              create formally diverse works within a compressed timeline.
            </p>
            <p>
              2 ) <i>Touchpoints</i> is a business-world concept which refers to
              the various modalities through which consumers interact with a
              product. Examples of touchpoints include ads, social media
              content, in-store merchandising, and the product itself, the sum
              encounter of which shape perception and decision-making before,
              during, and after purchase.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both frameworks encourage a medium and discipline agnostic
              approach to making, albeit for different purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
              What if we adopted these approaches for our own practices, for our
              own means? What if we start with the interplay between modalities
              as a given, rather than expecting a single form to contain the
              essence of a work? What if there is no “primary” way to experience
              something anymore?

              can mean a “total work of art,” a “universal artwork,” or a
              “synthesis of the arts.”

              Richard Wagner, a composer known primarily for his operas,
              popularized the term throughout his career which explored
              combining musical, visual, and dramatic art into an all-embracing
              theatrical whole.

            <p>
              Bauhaus, the German school of design, architecture, and applied
              arts, was also grounded in the concept. As described in Fred
              Turner’s book <i>The Democratic Surround</i>, artist and Bauhaus
              art school educator László Moholy-Nagy argued that design schools
              offer the kind of training that would strengthen individual
              American character and American society as a whole in the face of
              fascism in a 1940 article titled “Relating the Parts to the Whole”
              —
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              “WE NEED IN LARGE NUMBERS a new type of person — one who sees the
              periphery as well as the immediate, and who can integrate his
              special job with the great whole of which it is a small part. This
              ability is a matter of everyday efficiency. It will also
              contribute to building a better culture.”

              As our understanding of what could be considered Gesamtkunstwerk expanded, so did our curiosity about what reconsidering this art historical concept in our current climate might provoke. What does it mean to think through a “total work of art” framework today? We call it “TWA” —

              “Total work of art” has associations of dominance, control,

              practices. What control is even possible, we ask, in a gig
              economy, where we are required to switch modes, pass between
              contexts, and move between mediums constantly?

              But what if we made with air? Air is the gap around and between
              the work you make. At first it might seem like none of it is
              related, but with a little intention you can bring your seemingly
              disparate parts and the spaces between them together. How can you
              make not a work, but an atmosphere?

              It’s a fitting coincidence that TWA is the name of a now defunct
              airline, whose narrative continues in the form of a hotel — the legend lives
              on? Creating in this fashion is no easy task, but it is a
              generative provocation, one that suggests bringing in a “total
              work of art” mindset not to control an outcome, but to encourage a
              process that considers the interplay between things.

            <p class="question">( &nbsp;&nbsp;What is the class format?&nbsp;&nbsp; )</p>
            <p>
              The class meets for thirteen sessions over the course of seven weeks. Sessions happen on Sunday afternoons (noon-4pm) and Thursday evenings (7-9pm) in part of June, all of July, and the very beginning of August. Sessions include conversational lectures, technical
              demonstrations, presentation and critique time. We meet in-person at Telos in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York.
              Specific dates: 6.22 (Orientation), 6.26, 6.28, 7.3, 7.6, 7.10, 7.13, 7.17, 7.20, 7.24, 7.27, 7.31, 8.3 (Finale).

              ( &nbsp;&nbsp;What will I be making in class?&nbsp;&nbsp; )
            </p>
            <p>
The class explores a project in three forms: 1) digital, 2) physical, 3) temporal. You will be expected to shapeshift your concept into these modalities. During the digital, you may make a website, a digital publication, or an app, for example. During physical, you may create a sculpture, an installation, a book. For temporal, you might orchestrate an event, a gathering, or some other ephemeral encounter.

<p class="question">
  ( &nbsp;&nbsp;What is the expected workload?&nbsp;&nbsp; )
</p>
<p>
  Outside of the weekly class hours, participants are expected to further develop their projects between meetings.</p>
  <p class="question">
    ( &nbsp;&nbsp;Do I need any technical experience to join?&nbsp;&nbsp; )
  </p>
  <p>
There are no strict prerequisites. However, this class includes a number of technical tutorials. Students are expected to have an aptitude for visual production and ideation (both physical and digital), and a base familiarity with creating things digitally (website, app, digital publication, etc.). </p>
<p class="question">
  ( &nbsp;&nbsp;What materials do I need?&nbsp;&nbsp; )
</p>
<p>
Literally, participation requires a laptop computer, plus any other materials you imagine your TWA requires. Additionally, to apply and do well in the class, you will also need a “point of departure” — the place from where you'll explore multiple modalities.
</p>
<p class="question">
  ( &nbsp;&nbsp;What’s the point of departure?&nbsp;&nbsp; )
</p>
<p>
  The “point of departure” 🛫 is the place from where you’ll explore multiple modalities. Think of it like a core concept or a mantra — you can always return to it even if many things change. Start to imagine it evolving into digital, physical, and temporal expressions. Do you have any specific visions? What grounds / anchors you in this idea? Take some time to think about this, as you will continue to reference it throughout the duration of the class.
</p>
<p class="question">
  ( &nbsp;&nbsp;Can I participate remotely?&nbsp;&nbsp; )
</p>
<p>
  This summer, we are only doing in-person in NYC. But feel free to write us at twa@ultralight.school if you are interested in future possible virtual offerings.
</p>
<p class="question">
  ( &nbsp;&nbsp;Are there scholarships available?&nbsp;&nbsp; )
</p>
<p> Yes, there are two half-priced slots available for individuals who need help funding the class. </p>
<p class="question">
  ( &nbsp;&nbsp;Who might be good for this class?&nbsp;&nbsp; )
</p>
<p>
  We imagine this class is ideal for anyone — designers, artists, writers, programmers, and others — who has a strong concept or idea they are excited to shapeshift and explore through multiple mediums. Since this class meets twice a week (on Thursday evenings and Sunday afternoons), we imagine it’s best for people with some air in their schedules. We’d also like to form a complementary and supportive cohort (see our <a href="../../transmissions/code-of-conduct/">code of conduct</a>), so we welcome anyone with specific perspectives and/or skills who are also excited to witness and encourage others’ projects as they evolve.
